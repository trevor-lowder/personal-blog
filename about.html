            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Trevor, and I am a US Air Force Veteran with a passion for 
            tech, learning, and creativity. Looking for a remote job in the wake of the
            pandemic led me to web development. I quickly fell in love with the thrill
            of learning programming languages, which paralleled my experience learning Japanese
            when I was stationed in Japan during my time in the military, and solving complex
            problems, like the challenging puzzles in RPGs that I enjoy. Transitioning into tech
            has been a challegning and rewarding journey, and I'm very excited to see where 
            it takes me in the future. Thanks for visiting, and if you want to learn more
            and connect with me, check out my <a href="https://www.github.com/trevor-lowder">GitHub</a>
